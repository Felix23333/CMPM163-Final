CMPM163-Final Sealed Element sword

CMPM163 Sealed element sword Group member: Felix Li, Daniel Zhong, Jiahui Li

"Why?":

I and my teammates are gamers and really like RPG games, We really want to make a really beautiful game scene. We were inspired by a scene that renders a sword called Wolf's Gravestone in Genshin impact. Here is the video: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV13t4y1k743, it's made by UE4 but we want to recreate this kind of element sword in unity (definitely need to simplify).

"How?":

In this project, our group will render a game theme that contains a sealed water element sword. We will first render a water-theme background. To render a background, we will use texture mapping & build some basic object models, also with shader texture animation (with waters). Also using unity to create a scene that in the night and use moonlight, also use unity to create the terrain. (Less focus of the project, 20-30% of the work).

We will mainly focus on rendering the water element sword. We will use 3d modeling to build the object, and also use UV texture mapping to attach the texture to the sword. Also, use the unity shader lab to animate the sword texture. We will also use unity particle systems effects to let the sword become more beautiful. We will make the costume particle path and particle texture. (The main focus of the project, 70-80% of the work).

"What?":

The main challenge of the project is first to build a sword model, it may contain some complex shapes and it may need some time. Second, we need to self-learning how to make costume particle systems. It also need some time, but we think we can make it. We have enough knowledge to complete other tasks of the project, we can do it quickly and great.
